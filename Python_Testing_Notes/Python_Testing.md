## PYTHON-TESTING


> NOTE: Pytest and Unittest are two different testing frameworks.

### Pytest: A testing framework that offers a more concise and intuitive way of writing tests compared to unittest. It emphasizes simplicity, scalability and ease of use, making it a favored choice among developers.

### Unittest: A built-in Python testing framework, is part of the standard library.

### These are the assert methods p

| Method                | Checks that         |
|-----------------------|---------------------|
| `assertEqual(a, b)`   | `a == b`            |
| `assertNotEqual(a, b)`| `a != b`            |
| `assertTrue(x)`       | `bool(x) is True`   |
| `assertFalse(x)`      | `bool(x) is False`  |
| `assertIs(a, b)`      | `a is b`            |
| `assertIsNot(a, b)`   | `a is not b`        |
| `assertIsNone(x)`     | `x is None`         |
| `assertIsNotNone(x)`  | `x is not None`     |
| `assertIn(a, b)`      | `a in b`            |
| `assertNotIn(a, b)`   | `a not in b`        |
| `assertIsInstance(a, b)` | `isinstance(a, b)` |
| `assertNotIsInstance(a, b)` | `not isinstance(a, b)` |
