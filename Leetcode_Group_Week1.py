Hey guys, welcome to our first leetcode meeting.

Our goal is to train our brain and learn how to get to the solution no matter
how hard the quesiton is instead of memorizing solutions.

Leetcode is hard and can be overwhelming. That's why we need a good strategy.
So from the beginning, we need practice properly.

It doesn't matter how many problems you have solved before, if you are using
the wrong strategy, it's not going to help you much.


Think of technical interviews as collaborative problem-solving. You are there
to solve that problem with another person. The interviewer doesn't want to see
you just solving a question by yourself.

Two main things interviewers look for:
1. How you handle stress.
2. How you communicate.
3. how you handle feedback. EX: "Yo
    EX: They may not give you all the information to solve the problem,
        They want you to ask questions and communicate with them.
    EX: They may say that you're code is slow and is running O(N^2) time comp.
        They will ask you to optimize your code, and even if you don't know
        a way to optimize, at least know where and why your code is slow.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Topics we will work on:
First we will work on strong data structure foundations.

DATA STRUCTURES
    Arrays
    Hash Tables
    Stacks
    Queues
    Linked Lists
    Trees
    Graphs
    Tries (In a tree, each node holds a value. In a trie, nodes themselves dont hold a valueâ€”instead, the value is the path from the root to that node.)

Then we will target each algorithms.
ALGORITHMS
    Binary Search: Use on a sorted list to find elements fast.
    Two Pointers: When solving in place with no extra space.
    Sliding Window: For analyzing subsets within a set.
    BFS/DFS: BFS for shortest path in unweighted graphs; DFS for deep graph exploration.
    Recursion / Backtracking: Recursion for incremental solutions; Backtracking for exploring all possibilities.
    Divide and Conquer: Break problems into smaller, similar problems.
    Dynamic Programming: For overlapping subproblems, saves time with memoization.
    Bit Manipulation: For low-level integer operations.
    Topological Sort: Ordering of vertices in a directed graph without cycles.
    
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

KEY POINTS for every technical interview.

1. Ask questions and don't assume. Even if you solved the question before,
ask questions as if its your first time. We may not have the luxury of leetcode
telling us all the details regarding the problem.

    EX: You are given a list. Order the numbers inside from least to greatest.

    Are there any constraints to the parameter or solution?
    Will you be dealing with negative numbers?
    Will the numbers be in string or integer form?
    Should I consider edge cases such as empty list?
    Clarify what input they will give and what output they expect.
    Is it okay to use built-in functions?
    what to output if no solution is found?

2. If you are stuck during the coding stage, drop everything and go back to your
pseudocode. If your logic is good, coding part should be easy.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

PREP Methodology.

Parameters -- ALWAYS validate input first. Always consider edge case.

Return values -- What the function should return. 
    What output do you need in order for the test to work?

Examples -- Begin working through examples.
    Use examples to clarify edge cases and ensure your solution covers
    all possible scenarios.

Psuedocode -- A way to describe how to solve a problem using a simplified
    form of coding syntax.

psuedocode example:
    prompt: You are given a list. Order the numbers inside from least to greatest.
        1. For each index i in the list:
            a. Find the smallest number in the list from index i to the end
            b. Swap the smallest number found with the number at index i
        2. Return the sorted list


AFTER completion. Discuss how you can optimize. It is normal to sacrifice
space complexity for time complexity.
